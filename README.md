# The task is to load graphs and determine the following parameters:

### the degree sequence;
### the number of components;
### bipartiteness;
### vertices colours (consecutive natural numbers from 1) obtained using algorithm greedy (the vertex order according to its number);
### the number of the graph complement's edges;

## Input
### In the first line there's a number k of graphs.
### The following lines contain k graph data sets.
### A single data set contains a number n - the graph order - and n lists of neighbours for each vertex. A list contains the number of neighbours (s) and s neighbours IDs.
### Neighbours IDs are numbers from 1 to n.
